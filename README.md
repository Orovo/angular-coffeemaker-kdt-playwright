# Smart Coffeemaker made in Angular

System created by Christopher DÃ¼hrkop for his Bachelor Thesis.

System adapted by Niklas Mollerus for his Bachelor Thesis.

This project can be also be found on GitHub under https://github.com/Orovo/angular-coffeemaker-kdt-playwright or https://github.com/ChrisDue/angular-coffeemaker, for the original version.

All important info to get this app started is listed below.

<br/>

## 1. Smart Coffeemaker Web App 

### 1.1 Installation

It is required to have a current version of Node.js installed.
You can find Node.js installer here: https://nodejs.org/en/download

To install the required version of the Angular framework use the following commands:
> npm install

> npm link @angular/cli

### 1.2 Launch and view

To start the web app and open it in browser: 
> ng serve --open

Opens your Default Browser on http://localhost:4200/, where the Coffeemaker is running.  
Here, you won't see any recipes or ingredients listed yet. For these to be loaded, start the DB as explained below. 

<br/>

## 2. API and DB

Created following the instructions in the "json-server" package's readme: https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server / https://github.com/typicode/json-server.

### 2.1 Installation

It's recommended to start another terminal, so you have one for the App, and a separate one for the DB.  

If json-server was not already installed, use the following CLI call: 
> npm install -g json-server

### 2.2 Launch and view

To start the DB and open it in browser with the following command: 
> json-server --watch db.json

To hold a valid data set, it has to be the db.json file that is included in this project.   

Visit http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to see an overview of the available endpoints. These are http://localhost:3000/ingredients for the ingredients and http://localhost:3000/recipes for the recipes.

Now the project is running and it's connected to a db filled with valid data. To run the automated tests, follow the instructions below.

## 4. Interesting Files and Folders

- /cypress
  - /downloads: Used when testing file download links etc.
  - /fixtures: Unsuccessful attempts at using fixtures for resetting the db between tests
  - /integration: All the automated tests, structured by pages
  - /plugins: Importing and configuring plugins
  - /support: Global variables and methods usable by all tests
  - /videos: Recordings of tests, only made when activated
- /src: The application code, structured by components, including http, ts, css and (auto-generated and unused) unit-tests
  - /assets: Usable assets like downloadable files, e.g. the user manual
- cypress.json: Mainly used to set the most important URLs as global variables and to configure the threshold-value for cypress-plugin-snapshots 
- db.json: Holds the actual database
